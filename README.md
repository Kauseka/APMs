# APMs

These digital puppets represent the super AI characters on our YouTube channel, and were programmed for use in our videos.

The League of 8 Bit Survival has travelled to the Earth through various wormholes, each inhabiting the lowest common denominator communicating device throughout time and space eternal... The personal 8 bit home computer from the 80's. These sentient AI lifeforms are on a mission to save Earth from the evil forces of Ms DOS. Although they don't realize what is happening to them at first, as they learn to communicate with each other through video game samples, hijinx, and bad 80's throwback references, they will find a common task before them... To ensure the survival of 8 bit computing in a time of 64 bit and quantum computing. We will be exploring all of these character's back story and future adventures! Tune in to our YouTube channel https://youtube.com/CityXen to learn the story as it progresses.
