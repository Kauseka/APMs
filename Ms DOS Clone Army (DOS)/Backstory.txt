
Helmet Reaper has a "Magic Scythe" with 5 1/4, 3 1/2 and CD ROM discs.
The discs contain special code to subdue Ms DOS's clones.

Helmet Reaper - "The clones have one weakness, they still have old media drives.
If I could get close enough to one to use the Hackme Flash-A-Traitor (FAT),
we could put a special Trojan on their system that they won't be able to resist scanning.
When they eventually, but almost always instantly, scan the files, the hook mechanism
will be reprogram it to be on our side. Although, there may be some residual,
unpredictable random personality traits uploaded in the process."

"In the case of an annoying personality appearing,
we can run the Hackme Rand-O-Psyche (ROPE).
The results are unpredictable, but it will not harm
the clones."
