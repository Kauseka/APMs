CityXen was happily making great retro gaming, and vintage computer videos, when they found themselves in the
middle of an interdimensional AI war. Now they are in the frontlines of this battle between GOOD
and EVIL, and have formed the CIA to help centralize information about what kind of systems
they are finding, and to analyze their weaknesses.

Helmet Reaper has a "Magic Scythe" with 5 1/4, 3 1/2 and CD ROM discs.
The discs contain special code to subdue Ms DOS's clones. One simply has to insert the
media into a clone, or other machine, for it to take affect.

Helmet Reaper - "The clones have one weakness, they still have old media drives.
If I could get close enough to one to use the Hackme Flash-A-Traitor (FAT),
we could put a special Trojan on their system that they won't be able to resist scanning.
When they eventually, but almost always instantly, scan the files, the hook mechanism
will be reprogram it to be on our side. Although, there may be some residual,
unpredictable random personality traits uploaded in the process."

Helmet Reaper - "In the case of an annoying personality appearing, we can run the Hackme
Rand-O-Psyche (ROPE). The results are unpredictable, but it will not harm the clones, and
they will then do our bidding."

Eagull is a master of hardware. He can take apart systems and make things work together
that were not originally intended.

Mr. Robot is a cyborg. He can speak with machines that do not have vocoders, and translate.
He also can infiltrate the enemy lairs to gather intelligence undetected.
